                <p class="dropcap">Let's get straight to the point: amazing innovation happens when a large number of smart people believe their work can move a needle, and then they get to work.</p>
<h2>What's a "2 hour problem"?</h2>
<p>Through anecdotes and lived experience, I consider 2 hours to be the goldilocks zone of problem size - it's not minutes and it's not days. Just enough time to dive deep without being overwhelmed, and a duration that encourages immediate action. You can start almost immediately at the moment of inspiration and not run out of motivation and decide to "take a break" or "come back to it". Neither of those things are bad, but the flywheel of motivation runs better if it's constantly fed.</p>
<h2>Is ML there yet?</h2>
<p>It is not. Not yet. Any production system is more marathon than sprint, but in our nascent ML problem space, everything but the proverbial "Hello World" is a long exercise. Let's try to oversimplify what I'm talking about. What's the most fundamental breakdown of an ML system? What are the steps that you can describe in plain english?</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://blog.coldpress.ai/media/posts/4/data.png" alt="breaking down ml into three basic parts" width="1600" height="900" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 80vw" srcset="https://blog.coldpress.ai/media/posts/4/responsive/data-xs.png 384w ,https://blog.coldpress.ai/media/posts/4/responsive/data-sm.png 600w ,https://blog.coldpress.ai/media/posts/4/responsive/data-md.png 768w ,https://blog.coldpress.ai/media/posts/4/responsive/data-lg.png 1200w ,https://blog.coldpress.ai/media/posts/4/responsive/data-xl.png 1600w"></figure>
<h3>ML Ops</h3>
<p>Let's start from the back - ML Ops. This has perhaps been the hottest ML segment prior to the current wave of public interest. Model deployment, monitoring, maintainence, what have you. I could give you an idea of all the various problems that can be solved in this space and who is solving them well, but then I would be robbing you of the pleasure of reading this 50 page / 25 minute report by <a href="https://neptune.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neptune</a> titled "<a href="https://neptune.ai/blog/mlops-tools-platforms-landscape" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MLOps landscape in 2023</a>" and oof, is that a landscape. Our recommendation, go for one of the extremes: either an end-to-end solution like <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/products/machine-learning">AzureML</a>, or go barebones infra-rental with <a href="https://modal.com" target="_blank" style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);" rel="noopener">Modal</a>. But the presence of these many options shows that MLOps is the most mature part of the pipeline, and no matter your niche, you will find something that will fit.</p>
<p>I would argue that ML Ops isn't a part of the "2 hour problem" prototyping that we're talking about. But if MLOps is in your scope, then I think the industry is pretty close to making it a "2 hour problem".</p>
<h3>Model</h3>
<p>My favourite part of the problem, for reasons that are immediately obvious -- model training is the closest feeling to the archtype of the "hollywood hacker". No? Just me? Okay.</p>
<p>Years ago, developing a model from scratch used to be table stakes, just like how writing code on punch cards was table stakes for programming 60 years ago. But today, we're at a place where <code>pytorch</code>gives you a frankly insane number of pre-trained models ready to go -- all you need to do is fine-tune then for your use case (wink-wink).</p>
<p>Maybe you're a computer vision researcher? <a href="https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/models.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>torchvision</code> has got you covered</a>. Audio? <a href="https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/pipelines.html#module-torchaudio.pipelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">You got <code>torchaudio</code></a>. NLP? <a href="https://pytorch.org/text/stable/tutorials/t5_demo.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Obviously, there's <code>torchtext</code></a>. Don't like pytorch? Wow, maybe you're a <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/resources/models-datasets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TensorFlow</a> kind of person? Or <a href="https://huggingface.co/models"></a><a href="https://huggingface.co/models" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Huggingface</a>? Or <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/models" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaggle</a>? Or <a href="https://github.com/topics/pretrained-models" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Github</a>?</p>
<p>The point is, there are options. Many options. Maybe <em>too</em> many options. This part of the puzzle has moved squarely into the "2 hour problem" territory (much less, if you know what you're looking for). Of course, we'll keep making advances and improvements -- but where we already are is more than enough for any prototyping and the absence of models is no longer holding anyone back.</p>
<h3>Data</h3>
<p>Now comes the hairiest piece of the puzzle -- data. At the end of the day, I think everyone agrees that data makes or breaks your output. If <a href="https://www.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google believes they have no moat, and neither does Open AI</a>, they are talking about how data has the strongest correlation to final quality of result, which implies two distinct but related facts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Great data can compensate for a basic model</li>
<li>A great model can't compensate for poor data</li>
</ol>
<p>Whether you're starting afresh with a new problem, fine-tuning from existing pre-trained models, trying to improve your existing inference setup with a fresh injection of data, or trying to counter-act model drift, you're looking for your fix of bits and bytes. Whether or not you're starting your ML system from scratch, you start by scratching your head for the best place to find some data. And somehow, it feels like you always find everything but what you wanted. And our research indicates that in 2023, &gt;50% of data scientists aren't satisfied with the data they have.</p>
<p>In the absence of good data, people go down one of three roads. They either abandon the project because of a newly discovered data-barrier of entry, or, they choose to change the goals of the project to accomodate for the absence of proper training material, or, they do a primary collection / preparation / annotation of data via a provider like <a href="https://scale.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scale AI</a> or <a href="https://appen.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Appen</a>. Unfortunately, a lot of projects don't have either the time or the money to wait it out long enough for option #3.</p>
<p>Now, dream with me for a second. What if there was a secret option #4? What if you could get your hands on data, exactly for your use-case, pre-labelled and ready to go instantly? What if you could pick from the absolute best open datasets available under one roof? What if you could use industry-leading licensed data in a couple of clicks? What if you only had the development or fine-tuning of your model to worry about? You could still choose to use your own data, but it would no longer block you from starting up. In fact, a combination of in-house data and industry-standard data might just take you to new heights that neither would take you to alone.</p>
<p>That's what we're building here at Coldpress AI. <em>Yay! Time for the plug</em>. We are the largest library of computer vision datasets on the internet. Whether you're building self-driving cars, autonomous farmer bots, or just generally looking around for a way to make yourself the SeeFood app from Silicon Valley -- Coldpress AI is the place to pick up your bits.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: inherit;">Why use Coldpress AI?</span></h2>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">But wait, there's more! An often-underestimated aspect of datasets is the accuracy of labelling and annotation. Picture this: you're training your model using a dataset in which an adorable puppy is mislabeled as a fearsome grizzly bear. As endearing as that mental image might be, it spells disaster for your model's ability to correctly identify and categorize images.</span></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://coldpress.ai/premium?ref=blog-reverse-engineering-excellence" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Pssst, hey you, yes you. Coldpress AI can help you find large, high-res, clean, representative, balanced, and well-annotated for computer vision.</span></a></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Good data processed well can be good data multiplied</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Once you have your hands on a good dataset, you might think the job is half done. And it is, so hurray! But a lot remains - specifically, data processing.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Your journey takes you everywhere from basics like image size standardization to intermediate necessities like denoising, equalization, and normalization. You can even take the optional steps to do grey-scale conversion to speed up learning while preserving most of the learning potential of a dataset (for most use cases but not all).</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Feature extraction during this phase can also help you get better results later, in conjunction with manual annotation. Tasks like edge detection, </span><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale-invariant_feature_transform" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SIFT</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) / </span><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speeded_up_robust_features" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">SURF</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> (Speeded-Up Robust Features) and </span><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_of_oriented_gradients" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">HOG</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) can help you make your dataset a more informative and compact representation of what it's supposed to represent.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">And finally, data augmentation. The often-ignored but amazingly valuable way to increase the size and diversity of the dataset - if done correctly. By applying various transformations such as rotation, flipping, scaling, or adding noise, you can create new training examples that help the model generalize better. Imagine a dataset of cats lounging in various positions. Augmenting this data with flipped, rotated, or zoomed-in versions of these images helps our model grasp the feline essence.</span></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://coldpress.ai/generate?ref=blog-reverse-engineering-excellence" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Oh, by the way, did you know that you can find tools on Coldpress AI to augment your datasets? Yeah! Our interpolate APIs can help you do just that</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. Wow, what a coincidence that that came up so organically!</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">No model, no performance</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Models are no longer crucial differentiators for most projects and use-cases - they're well on their way to being commoditized for most requirements. However, the fact that you can't go too wrong doesn't mean you don't have work to do.</span></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">CNNs</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> (Convolutional Neural Networks) are the classical choice for image-related AI tasks, but </span><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_transformer" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Vision Transformers</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> are on the rise in popularity. You can find pre-trained models all over the internet, including on Huggingface and Kaggle. As we said, hard to go too wrong, if you bring the right dataset, processing, parameter tuning, and attitude to the table!</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Speaking of parameter tuning, let's talk hyperparameter tuning. You can take a pick of strategies individually, or a combination thereof - Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization (and many others). The idea is to find a configuration that maximizes your model's performance - but don't let hyperparameter tuning turn into hyperparameter over-optimization. In fact, you can strategically avoid over-optimization by doing some regularization. L1 and L2 regularizations add a penalty to the model's loss function, and help discourage overly complex model development. Dropout is another popular regularization technique for neural networks, where a random subset of neurons is "dropped out" during training, forcing the model to rely on feature diversity.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Evaluate, Validate, Wait</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Can't be impressive unless you test, right? You can test using the classic Train-Validation-Test split. Segment your dataset into three distinct subsets: training, validation, and testing. The "training" set is used to learn the model's parameters, the "validation" set helps with hyperparameter tuning and model selection, and the "testing" set serves as the final evaluation to gauge the model's performance on unseen data. Or, you could go fancier and use something like </span><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">K-fold Cross-validation</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> - where you cut the dataset into k equally-sized folds, the model is trained k times (each time using k-1 folds for training and the remaining fold for validation) and the average performance across all runs serves as the overall performance metric.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">This is also the step where you should be looking to zero down on your performance metric of choice. Maybe some of our old writing can help here - </span><a target="_blank" href="https://blog.coldpress.ai/a-very-serious-guide-for-decoding-model-accuracy-precision-recall-and-f1.html?ref=blog-reverse-engineering-excellence" class="editor-rtfLink" rel="noopener"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">we recently did an explainer for some standard ways to measure the performance of your model</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.</span></p>
<h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Conclusion</span></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Well, there you have it folks - if you have a successful computer vision model today, then these are some things you probably did to get here. Is there something we missed? Let us know we're always looking to learn here at Coldpress!</span></p>

<p class="dropcap">Okay I lied, this is only a mildly serious guide. With that disclosure out of the way and our conscience being clear, let's dive into the age-old question for the umpteenth time: accuracy, precision, recall, or F1? Which one should you choose to track the performance of your AI model? The answer is, frustratingly and always, that it depends. But don't worry, we're here to guide you through the jungle of metrics and help you make the right choice.</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 16.5478%;"><strong>Metric</strong></td>
<td style="width: 41.2242%;"><strong>What it is</strong></td>
<td style="width: 42.228%;"><strong>What it measures</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 16.5478%;"><strong>Accuracy</strong></td>
<td style="width: 41.2242%;">Number of correct predictions divided by total number of predictions</td>
<td style="width: 42.228%;">How often the model is correct</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 16.5478%;"><strong>Precision</strong></td>
<td style="width: 41.2242%;">Number of true positive predictions divided by the sum of true positive and false positive predictions</td>
<td style="width: 42.228%;">Proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 16.5478%;"><strong>Recall</strong></td>
<td style="width: 41.2242%;">Number of true positive predictions divided by the sum of true positive and false negative predictions</td>
<td style="width: 42.228%;">Proportion of actual positive cases that were correctly predicted</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 16.5478%;"><strong>F1</strong></td>
<td style="width: 41.2242%;">Harmonic mean of precision and recall</td>
<td style="width: 42.228%;">Composite metric, it is a balance of precision and recall</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now, why is picking your north star metric not a simple and obvious choice? Why must the diplomatic "it depends" raise its head again here? As with most things, the pesky issue is the abstract best that is market dynamics. Let's see:</p>
<p>Sometimes, accuracy is a great metric to use. For example, if you're building a model to predict whether it's going to rain tomorrow, accuracy is probably the way to go. If the model predicts rain and it doesn't rain, or if it predicts no rain and it does rain, the consequences are not severe. However, if you're building a model to predict whether a patient has a certain disease, the consequences of false positive or false negative predictions can be much more severe. In this case, you want to use precision, recall, or F1 to ensure that your model is not only correct, but also not making false positive or false negative predictions.</p>
<p>Ooh, ooh, look, another intricacy is rearing its head. It's amazing to see it in the wild. Nature, man. This one called "imbalanced datasets". If your dataset is imbalanced, accuracy can be a misleading metric. For example, if you have a dataset of 99% negative cases and 1% positive cases, a model that always predicts negative will have an accuracy of 99%. But clearly, this is not a useful model. In these cases, precision, recall, or F1 may be a better choice. That said, the smart choice in case you find yourself wrangling with a dataset clearly imbalanced to that degree, you're better served throwing it in a trash can and <a href="https://coldpress.ai/premium?ref=blog-a-very-serious-guide-for-decoding-model-accuracy-precision-recall-and-f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hitting us up at Coldpress AI to find something better</a>.</p>
<p>So, what's the verdict? Well, it's like I said at the beginning: it depends. But, in general, if you're building a model for a low-stakes application, accuracy is probably fine. If you're building a model for a high-stakes application, you may want to use precision, recall, or F1. And if your dataset is imbalanced, be cautious about relying on anything.</p>
<p>One more interesting thing is the issue of stratification in F1, down to the fact that models typically solve multiple use cases which can have differeing levels of business importance, so something that has a 0.95 f-score can still wildly vary between use cases in terms of end-user satisfaction. This stratification is a topic of intense research that we're both doing and keeping tabs on. <a href="https://coldpress.ai/horizon?ref=blog-a-very-serious-guide-for-decoding-model-accuracy-precision-recall-and-f1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sign up here to stay in the loop</a>!</p>

<p class="dropcap">Friends, Data Scientists, countrymen (and countrywomen), lend me your ears. I come to introduce you to Coldpress AI - a Machine Learning supermarket. We started this venture to ease the pain of AI development experience, believing that AI can be as fun to develop as it is to use.</p>
<p>Let me take you through our establishment. On your left, you'll see the first aisle - our open dataset platform. We're building the largest catalog of open datasets in the world, so that it's not a wild goosechase when you want to experiment with a new idea and you spend weeks and months looking for what's available in the fantastic but fragmented frontiers of the open source community. <a href="https://coldpress.ai/explore?ref=blog-hello-world-introducing-coldpress-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Check it out here</a> - it's a work in progress, and it will only get better with time!</p>
<p>If you look to your right, you'll find our crown jewel - premium datasets from the foremost producers in the market. The relationship between model accuracy and data quality is well known to the point of being canonical, and yet premium datasets are some of the least "discoverable" parts of AI development. No more - with Coldpress datasets, you get an easily navigable catalog of datasets relevant to you, available instantly with your resolution and refresh rates of choice. And in the interest of making your experience superlative, we have an extra goodie for you - your own data assistant. If you don't find what you're looking for, you simply tell us and we do the search and negotiation for you, and make it available to you through the reliable consistency our our API. Once you start getting your data from Coldpress, you will never need anything else. If this is your cup of your-beverage-of-choice, you can <a href="https://coldpress.ai/premium?ref=blog-hello-world-introducing-coldpress-ai">find it here</a>.</p>
<p>The next section is our super-secret R&amp;D lab, developing super-secret ways to produce synthetic data. You can interpolate your existing dataset, extrapolate from a few samples, and soon, even make something from nothing. One day, we think data production can be as simple as making an image on Midjourney or a blog post on ChatGPT. It's not there today, but we're making progress. Our first foray is our data augmentation API - the first rung of data engineering. To get started, you'll find features like flipping images horizontally, vertically, or both; rotating images; adjusting the brightness or contrast; and even adding random noise. The idea is that these transformed images will provide additional examples for the algorithm to learn from, training it on a much larger and more diverse dataset than you ever could before. You can <a href="https://coldpress.ai/generate?ref=blog-hello-world-introducing-coldpress-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">request access for it right now</a>.</p>
<p>The last section is our even-more-secret R&amp;D lab, developing even-more-secret ways to make your life better. We keep an ear to the ground, and an eye to the horizon, looking out not just for your data needs today, but thinking about your data needs tomorrow. We collaborate with the brightest minds in academia, becoming the bridge through which today's research can help shape tomorrow's reality. We're currently focussing on building adverserial training datasets for common use-cases. Our upcoming projects include helping businesses tie the relation between measure model performance and business performance more reliably. You can <a href="https://coldpress.ai/horizon?ref=blog-hello-world-introducing-coldpress-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up for updates</a> here to stay tuned (or even better, let us know what you'd like to see on our roadmap)  - this will be an interesting ride!</p>
<p>In short, we believe this is the end of your need to repeatedly scour the internet for datasets. No more worrying about the quality of what you've found, and no more pulling your hair out trying to augment it. Coldpress AI has got you covered. Imagine all the time and energy you'll save by not having to do any of those things - you might be able to add a siesta to your daily routine.<em> <span class="ILfuVd" lang="en"><span class="hgKElc">¡</span></span>Que bien!</em></p>
<p>Now you might be looking at all of this and be asking yourself, "when exactly will I use all this?" And I'm glad you asked, because I'm happy to say that we have very clearly defined our use cases. Imagine this: bad guys have broken into your home and are holding your beloved pet housefly hostage. Their ask for ransom? 10 GBs of photos of spiders in low lighting conditions. Until yesterday, this would've landed you in quite a pickle. But today, you can just come to Coldpress AI, and we will help you out. And maybe you can tell the bad guys about us, so they don't have to resort to nefarious acts to fulfil their data needs.</p>
<p>So there you have it, folks. Coldpress AI, the future of data. Don't wait, <a href="https://coldpress.ai/login/?ref=blog-hello-world-introducing-coldpress-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign up today</a> and see for yourself!</p>
